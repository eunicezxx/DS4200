                        The film industry is a complex landscape where box office revenue, production costs, and
                        audience reception may make or break a film.
                        Since we are all passionate about film, our enthusiasm sparked our idea for this project. We
                        often find ourselves discussing our
                        favorite films and the factors that contribute to a film's impact, and this collective interest
                        led us to want to explore the relationship between production
                        budgets, box office revenue, and critical reception. This topic is interesting because movie
                        success can be defined by many different factors, some of which may not
                        necessarily occur together. For example, does domestic success guarantee global success? Do
                        audience ratings predict box office performance?
                        Because the factors that impact box office success can be so fragile, and often must justify the
                        investment of production budgets,
                        we thought this would be an interesting relationship to explore. We became interested in the
                        relationship between production money invested in the film,
                        box office, and critical reception (audience ratings).
                        Our project will seek to understand these relationships through a data-driven approach,
                        exploring a dataset of film information to identify the differences in financial return and
                        critical reception of films as a function of their production budget. We can use our findings to
                        help filmmakers, investors, and analysts determine whether future films will succeed.

                        This bar chart illustrates the average domestic and worldwide box office revenues for movies grouped by their rounded audience rating (from 1 to 10). For each rating level, we calculated the mean gross revenue among all films that received that score.
From the chart, we observe that movies with higher audience ratings generally tend to earn more both domestically and worldwide. The average revenue rises significantly for films with ratings between 7 and 9, suggesting that positively rated movies are more likely to succeed commercially. There is also a noticeable gap between domestic and worldwide gross in higher rating levels, indicating a strong global appeal for well-rated films.

                        This box plot visualizes how audience ratings vary across movies with different production budget categories. Each box represents the distribution of ratings for low, mid, and high-budget films. We can see whether higher budgets are associated with better audience reception and also identify notable outliers that defy the general trend.

Users can easily explore trends by hovering over each point to see the exact value. It provides a more dynamic way to examine whether films with higher ratings generate more revenue, and how the two genres' total revenues compare.
