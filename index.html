                        The film industry is a complex landscape where box office revenue, production costs, and
                        audience reception may make or break a film.
                        Since we are all passionate about film, our enthusiasm sparked our idea for this project. We
                        often find ourselves discussing our
                        favorite films and the factors that contribute to a film's impact, and this collective interest
                        led us to want to explore the relationship between production
                        budgets, box office revenue, and critical reception. This topic is interesting because movie
                        success can be defined by many different factors, some of which may not
                        necessarily occur together. For example, does domestic success guarantee global success? Do
                        audience ratings predict box office performance?
                        Because the factors that impact box office success can be so fragile, and often must justify the
                        investment of production budgets,
                        we thought this would be an interesting relationship to explore. We became interested in the
                        relationship between production money invested in the film,
                        box office, and critical reception (audience ratings).
                        Our project will seek to understand these relationships through a data-driven approach,
                        exploring a dataset of film information to identify the differences in financial return and
                        critical reception of films as a function of their production budget. We can use our findings to
                        help filmmakers, investors, and analysts determine whether future films will succeed.

                        The scatterplot above shows movie budgets and their domestic and worldwide gross. The blue dots represent worldwide gross and the red dots represent domestic gross. 
                        We chose to plot the two on the same graph to show that both domestic and worldwide gross appear 
                        to increase as movie budget increases, potentially indicating a weak positive linear correlation. We can also see that the worldwide gross tends to be higher, 
                        which is expected, because worldwide gross includes more opportunities for revenue. The chart is interactive, 
                        so you can select whether you want to only see the worldwide or the domestic gross.

                        In this visualization, we plot the two regression lines for the budgets vs. domestic and worldwide gross. 
                        We can see that both lines (with domestic in red and worldwide in blue) have a positive slope,
                        indicating a positive correlation. Interestingly, the blue line, representing worldwide gross,
                        has a steeper slope than the red line, representing domestic gross. Thus, we can conclude that 
                        for the worldwide gross, the budget correlates more strongly with the revenue.

                        This bar chart illustrates the average domestic and worldwide box office revenues for movies grouped by their rounded audience rating (from 1 to 10). For each rating level, we calculated the mean gross revenue among all films that received that score.
From the chart, we observe that movies with higher audience ratings generally tend to earn more both domestically and worldwide. The average revenue rises significantly for films with ratings between 7 and 9, suggesting that positively rated movies are more likely to succeed commercially. There is also a noticeable gap between domestic and worldwide gross in higher rating levels, indicating a strong global appeal for well-rated films.

                        This box plot visualizes how audience ratings vary across movies with different production budget categories. Each box represents the distribution of ratings for low, mid, and high-budget films. We can see whether higher budgets are associated with better audience reception and also identify notable outliers that defy the general trend.

                        Our visual analysis explores the relationship between a film’s production budget, its box office performance (both domestic and worldwide), and its audience reception. By combining insights from line charts, scatterplots, and a custom-designed bubble chart, we reveal how these factors interact in complex and sometimes surprising ways.

                    <p>
                        The line chart comparing production budgets with gross revenues demonstrates a general trend: Films with higher budgets tend to earn more, particularly in the global market, where international audiences significantly boost box office totals. However, the relationship is not strictly linear. Many high-budget films exhibit greater volatility—some achieving multibillion-dollar success, while others underperform despite massive investment. Interestingly, films with moderate budgets (under $150M) are far more densely represented, indicating that this range may offer a balance between market appeal and manageable risk.

                    <p>
                        The bubble chart adds a new dimension to this analysis by introducing audience rating as a visual cue through bubble size and color. This chart highlights that high audience approval is not limited to high-budget films. Many mid- or low-budget productions are highly rated, suggesting that storytelling quality, creativity, and execution play a more decisive role in audience satisfaction than raw financial input. Conversely, some high-budget films received average or even poor ratings, reinforcing the idea that large production costs do not guarantee critical or popular success.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further insights from the visualizations on our website support these conclusions. For example, genre analysis shows that certain types of films, such as dramas and documentaries, tend to earn higher audience ratings, while big-budget genres like action or adventure often drive box office returns regardless of critical reception. Additionally, rating stability appears linked to popularity: movies with more votes tend to have consistent ratings, while lesser-known films often exhibit polarized audience reactions. There is also evidence of an upward trend in both average budget and global earnings over time, reflecting the increasing prevalence of high-stakes blockbusters in the modern film industry.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These visualizations underscore a nuanced truth: while budget plays a role in shaping a film’s financial potential, it does not dictate audience sentiment. The most successful films — both commercially and critically — often strike a delicate balance between creative integrity and production scale. Our findings suggest that studios may benefit from strategically investing in mid-budget projects with strong storytelling, which can deliver both financial returns and long-lasting audience impact.
