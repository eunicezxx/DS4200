                            The film industry is incredibly complex: box office revenue, production costs, or
                            audience reception may make or break a film.
                            Since we are all passionate about films, we wanted to investigate a movie-related dataset.
                            Our collective interest
                            led us to want to explore the relationship between production
                            budgets, box office revenue, and audience reception. This topic is interesting because movie
                            success can be defined by many different factors, some of which may not
                            necessarily occur together. Additionally, movies are often huge investments, so movie
                            success is incredibly important.
                            We can ask many interesting questions, such as: does domestic success guarantee global
                            success? Do
                            audience ratings predict box office performance?
                            Because the factors that impact box office success can be so fragile, and often must justify
                            the
                            investment of production budgets,
                            we thought this would be an interesting relationship to explore. We became interested in the
                            relationship between production money invested in the film,
                            box office, and critical reception (audience ratings).
                            Our project task is to understand these relationships through a data-driven
                            approach,
                            exploring a dataset of film information to identify the differences in financial return and
                            critical reception of films as a function of their production budget. We can use our
                            findings to
                            help filmmakers, investors, and analysts determine whether future films will succeed.

                        <p>
                            Our project will use a dataset of movie statistics from Kaggle titled The Ultimate Film Statistics Dataset - for ML. The dataset sources include Wikipedia, The Numbers, and IMDb. The size of the dataset is 4241 rows and 14 columns. We can download the data as a .csv file. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The dataset provides comprehensive statistics related to the film, with each row representing a movie. First, it includes general information about each movie: the movie titles, production dates, genres, runtime minutes, and director information. Then, it includes information about the audience reception of the movie, such as the average ratings, number of votes, and approval index. Finally, it provides data related to the financial investment and success of the movie: production budgets, domestic gross earnings, and worldwide gross earnings. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Specifically, we will be focused on a few features: the movie titles, average ratings, production budgets, domestic gross earnings, and worldwide gross earnings. The movie titles are quite self-explanatory: unique strings that are the title for each movie. The average ratings are the average rating given by online users for a particular movie. This context is important because it means that the ratings may exclude populations that do not post reviews online, such as older or very young age groups. The production budgets are the amount of money used in USD to produce the movie. The domestic gross earnings are the revenue in USD earned from tickets sold in the movie’s home/domestic market. The worldwide gross earnings are the revenue earned from global ticket sales in USD. These characteristics will allow us to analyze the financial and audience popularity of films in different budget categories, making it suitable for our analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the structure of the data set, we will pre-process the data to ensure consistency and
                            accuracy. We will clean up missing or incorrect values, such as negative values.
                            We also break down audience scores into different categories and divide
                            movies into three budget categories to allow for further analysis.
                            Using the data, we can spot trends and anomalies in the film
                            industry.

                            The interactive scatter plot above shows the relationship between movie budgets and their
                            domestic and worldwide gross, with each point representing a movie. Color is used to
                            distinguish between gross types, where blue dots represent worldwide gross and the red dots
                            represent domestic gross. The x-axis is the production budget, and the y-axis is the gross
                            amount. The gridlines of the graph allow for easier identification of budget and gross
                            amounts.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-section">
                            Overall, there is a positive correlation between gross and budget. However, we can also see that there is a lot of variation in the points given the same budget, so budget is not the only factor that is important for movie success. Worldwide gross also tends to be greater than domestic gross, which is expected. In particular, outliers like Avengers: Endgame and Avatar: The Way of Water have extremely high worldwide gross amounts, showing the potential of targeting worldwide/international audiences. The highest grossing films, as expected, have the highest budgets, but most films tend to cost below 300 million dollars and make below 1.5 billion dollars in revenue, with only a few outliers surpassing these numbers.
We can see that both lines (with domestic in red and worldwide in blue) have a positive slope, indicating a positive correlation, where higher budgets tend to be associated with higher gross amounts for both worldwide and domestic gross. Interestingly, the blue line, representing worldwide gross, has a steeper slope than the red line, representing domestic gross. Therefore, the main takeaway is that movie producers may want to target international audiences, as a higher budget tends to mean more gains worldwide than domestically.

                        While this is expected, the graph emphasizes how large this difference can be.
                        Especially, for movies that have a very high budget, there is a larger difference in these two
                        values.
                        Additionally, the lines in the graph show how much the revenue can vary. The many peaks in the

                        This grouped bar chart illustrates the average domestic and worldwide box office revenues for
                        movies
                        grouped by their rounded audience rating (from 1 to 10). For each rating level, we calculated
                        the mean gross revenue among all films that received that score.
                        From the chart, we observe that movies with higher audience ratings generally tend to earn more
                        both domestically and worldwide. The average revenue rises significantly for films with ratings
                        between 7 and 9. This suggests that positively rated movies are more likely to succeed
                        commercially. There is also a noticeable gap between domestic and worldwide gross in higher

                        worldwide gross tend to be higher when ratings are higher, which is expected, as better movies
                        should attract more viewers. The average worldwide gross is also always much higher than the
                        domestic gross, which reinforces what we saw in previous graphs: that appealing to an
                        international audience can be very financially beneficial.

                        As seen in the last visualization, the worldwide gross is higher than the domestic gross for all rating levels, and a higher rating tends to mean a higher gross. However, this visualization gives us more information about the distributions for each rating. Specifically, the median of the worldwide gross is always higher than the median for the domestic gross. This means that the difference was not just due to high outliers: the actual distribution of data supports that the worldwide gross truly tends to be higher than the domestic gross. For each rating, we also observe that there is a lot of variability, indicated by the length of the whiskers. Specifically, films that are rated higher appear to experience more variability in gross. Interestingly, many distributions are right skewed because of very high outliers, which makes sense because there will always be some movies that are extremely popular with extreme amounts of revenue. Overall, for an individual movie, rating does not seem to be a precise predictor of revenue, as there is so much variability in revenue for each group. However, as we can see by the locations of the medians and distributions, the revenue does tend to increase with the rating.

                        This box plot visualizes how audience ratings vary across movies with different production

                        The main task is to compare the audience distributions across different budgets. The main
                        takeaway
                        is that ratings look very similar across all budgets, which is very interesting. The IQR
                        for each of the categories appears very similar. Therefore, spending more money does not
                        always mean a better quality film. Furthermore, this may possibly suggest that
                        a higher budget does not account for higher revenue because of ratings, as ratings
                        appear very similar across different categories of budgets.

                        The histogram shows the distribution of the ratings, which looks similar to a normal distribution. Most of the movies fall within the rating categories from 4 to 8. While a filmmaker may aim to create a movie with a rating of 9, it is also important to see that most films fall in the middle, which adjusts expectations for the ratings a movie might receive.

                        both a very high budget and a very high rating (such as Avengers: Endgame and Avatar: The Way of

                        Additionally, no matter what the rating category is, they all follow the trend of a higher
                        budget tending to be
                        associated with a higher revenue. Therefore, even very highly rated movies with low budgets

                       The main takeaway from this visualization is that runtime does not appear to be associated with domestic or worldwide revenue. We can see that there is a large amount of variability in gross for each runtime, and there does not appear to be a clear linear relationship between the runtime and gross. This means that whether a movie is extremely long or short does not influence the amount of tickets that are bought. This is an interesting finding because people may be reluctant to invest the time needed to watch longer movies. Surprisingly, the outliers that have extremely high revenues appear to have higher runtimes, contradicting this hypothesis. It may be that movies with longer runtimes are associated with experienced and well-known directors or franchises, leading to higher revenue. However, overall, there does not appear to be a relationship between revenue and runtime, and most movie runtimes appear to fall within 1-2 hours.

The top three are Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi, and the bottom three are Sport, Documentary, and Film-Noir. There appears to be a huge gap between the top performing genres and bottom performing genres, with the average worldwide revenue ranging from 8,573,840 to 304,682,054 dollars. Animation is by far the top performing genre, while genres in the middle of the chart appear to perform similarly (Thriller to Biography). Thus, the most lucrative genres appear to be those that appeal most broadly to people: Animation, Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Action tend to be watched by people of many demographics and ages, while Documentary and Film-Noir may only interest people with a specific interest in that genre. Genres appear to play a large role in film revenue.

                            Our data visualizations’ main task was to explore the relationship between the production
                            budget, audience ratings, and box office performances of movies, with a focus on what
                            produced the highest domestic and worldwide gross amounts. We used line charts, scatter
                            plots, a bar chart, box plots, and a histogram/bubble chart to explore the film dataset and to
                            understand how these factors affect each other in complicated ways.

                        <p>
                            The line chart comparing budgets and gross revenues showed that films with higher budgets do
                        tend to have higher gross amounts, with the worldwide gross being much higher than the domestic
                        gross. This might suggest that appealing to global, rather than domestic, audiences is
                        financially beneficial. However, we also saw in later graphs that there is a lot of variability,
                        and budget is not the only factor. Films with the same budget experience a lot of variability in
                        terms of their gross. Films with moderate budgets have dense representation, which may suggest
                        that this is a good balance between market appeal and managing investments/risk.

                        <p>
                            Later graphs introduced audience rating as an interesting factor. They demonstrated that a
                            higher audience rating does suggest higher revenue. The bubble chart showed that the films
                            that earn the most money overall have both a high budget and very high ratings. We also saw
                            that the movie quality actually remains quite similar across rating categories, suggesting
                            budget may affect revenue in a different way other than quality.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the last two graphs investigate runtime and genres as possible factors in 
                            movie financial success. While we found that runtime does not appear to 
                            be associated with revenue, genres do differ significantly in revenue,
                            with those appealing to broad audiences (Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi) 
                            grossing the highest on average.

                        <p>
                            A more interesting further exploration would be the audiences of 
                            movies. Do movies that appeal to particular demographics of people 
                            gross the highest? We have seen how genres influence revenue, 
                            so understanding what demographics different genres target 
                            could be an interesting addition to understanding what affects 
                            film financial success. Additionally, we can ask: how have
                            movies changed over time? Do the patterns between revenue and budget change over time, as
                            movie effects and editing become more advanced and as 
                            audiences change? These would be very interesting further
                            opportunities for exploration.

                            Overall, our analysis looked at the relationship between production budgets,
                            box office performance, runtime, genres, and ratings. We looked at takeaways across many 
                            different kinds of charts in order to understand how these factors come 
                            together to potentially influence a movie's revenue, sometimes in 
                            surprising ways.

                        <p>
                            The line chart that compared budgets and revenues showed that films with higher
                            budgets do tend to earn more. This is especially true for global revenue,
                            which we found to be consistently higher than domestic revenue. 
                            However, there is a lot of volatility, where films across all kinds of budgets 
                            still differ a lot in revenue, particularly for high budget films. Some break
                            box office records, while others severely underperform, despite high investmnet. 
                            We saw that films with moderate budgets are most common, 
                            so this range might be a good balance between investment and market appeal. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bubble chart also helped us look at audience ratings and relate them to budgets 
                            and revenues. High audience approval is not only for high budget films, and 
                            there are films of all budgets present in all ratings. We also saw this 
                            in our box plot, where audience ratings were similar across all budgets. 
                            Clearly, creativity, storytelling, and quality do not depend solely on budget, 
                            though the vast majority of films earn ratings between 4-8. 
                            However, across all ratings, there is a consistent trend: a higher budget 
                            does mean higher revenue. Thus, to achieve quality, a high budget is not 
                            needed, but to achieve extreme financial success, a high budget and a 
                            high rating are both necessary. 
                        </p>
                        <p>




                            Overall, these visualizations together demonstrate how maximizing movie revenue is extremely complex and challenging. While we saw that higher budgets tend to mean higher worldwide and domestic grosses, there is still a lot of variability in revenue across all budgets. Furthermore, we found that across all budgets, audience ratings tend to remain similar. Therefore, higher budgets do not guarantee good movies, despite better ratings also being associated with higher revenue. We found that the genres Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi are most financially successful, appealing to broad audiences. Thus, the best films, which achieve the most impactful financial success, require large production budgets, excellent audience ratings, and broad audience appeal. While these factors seem intuitive, it is also important that we looked to the data to confirm or reject our hypotheses rather than assuming they are true. After establishing these baseline factors, we can further delve into the data: do certain audiences spend more on movies? How have these trends changed over time? Do critic scores matter more than audience scores? Why are some films such significant outliers in revenue? There are many interesting and complex factors we can now further explore.
