                        <p>
                            The film industry is incredibly complex: box office revenue, production costs, or 
                            audience reception may make or break a film.
                            Since we are all passionate about films, we wanted to investigate a movie-related dataset.  
                            Our collective interest
                            led us to want to explore the relationship between production
                            budgets, box office revenue, and audience reception. This topic is interesting because movie
                            success can be defined by many different factors, some of which may not
                            necessarily occur together. Additionally, movies are often huge investments, so movie success is incredibly important. 
                            We can ask many interesting questions, such as: does domestic success guarantee global success? Do
                            audience ratings predict box office performance?
                            Because the factors that impact box office success can be so fragile, and often must justify the
                            investment of production budgets,
                            we thought this would be an interesting relationship to explore. We became interested in the
                            relationship between production money invested in the film,
                            box office, and critical reception (audience ratings).
                            Our project task is to seek to understand these relationships through a data-driven approach,
                            exploring a dataset of film information to identify the differences in financial return and
                            critical reception of films as a function of their production budget. We can use our findings to
                            help filmmakers, investors, and analysts determine whether future films will succeed.

                        <h2>Data</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our project will use a dataset of movie statistics from Kaggle titled The Ultimate Film
                            Statistics Dataset - for ML. The dataset sources include Wikipedia, The Numbers, and IMDb. The
                            size of the dataset is 4241 rows and 14 columns. We can download the data as a .csv file. The
                            dataset provides comprehensive statistics related to the film, such as: movie titles, production dates, genres, runtime minutes, director information, average ratings, number of votes, approval index, production budgets, domestic gross earnings, and worldwide gross earnings. 
                            These characteristics will
                            allow us to analyze the financial and audience popularity of films in different budget
                            categories, making it suitable for our analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the structure of the data set, we will pre-process the data to ensure consistency and
                            accuracy. We will clean up missing or incorrect values, such as negative values. 
                            We also break down audience scores into different categories and divide
                            movies into three budget ratings to allow for further analysis. 
                            Using the data, we can spot trends and anomalies in the film
                            industry.

                            This makes it easy to identify movie titles which are outliers and identify the exact gross or production amount for a particular point.

                            The interactive scatter plot above shows the relationship between movie budgets and their domestic and worldwide gross, with each point representing a movie. Color is used to distinguish between gross types, where blue dots represent worldwide gross and the red dots represent domestic gross. The x-axis is the production budget, and the y-axis is the gross amount. The gridlines of the graph allow for easier identification of budget and gross amounts. 

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-section">
                            The task for this plot was to identify outliers, explore whether there is a relationship between gross and budget, and explore whether there is a difference in this relationship for domestic vs. worldwide gross. We chose to plot the two types of gross on the same graph to show that both domestic and worldwide gross appear to increase as movie budgets increase, potentially indicating a weak positive linear correlation. We can also see that the worldwide gross tends to be higher, which is expected, because worldwide gross includes more opportunities for revenue. The chart is interactive, so you can select whether you want to only see the worldwide or the domestic gross.

                        <p class="text-section">
                            Overall, there is a positive correlation between gross and budget. However, we can also see that there is a lot of variation in the points given the same budget, so budget is not the only factor that is important for movie success. Worldwide gross also tends to be greater than domestic gross, which is expected. In particular, outliers like Avengers: Endgame and Avatar: The Way of Water have extremely high worldwide gross amounts, showing the potential of targeting worldwide/international audiences. The highest grossing films, as expected, have the highest budgets, but most films tend to cost below 300 million dollars and make below 1.5 billion dollars in revenue, with only a few outliers surpassing these numbers.

                        In this visualization, we plot the two regression lines for the budgets vs. domestic and worldwide gross. The budget is on the x-axis and the gross amount is on the y-axis. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-section">
                        From the last graph, we saw that there may be a positive relationship between budget and domestic and worldwide gross. Therefore, we wanted to explore it further by plotting the regression lines for each and comparing the two. Thus, we needed to use color to differentiate the two types of gross on the same graph. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-section">
                        We can see that both lines (with domestic in red and worldwide in blue) have a positive slope, indicating a positive correlation, where higher budgets tend to be associated with higher gross amounts for both worldwide and domestic gross. Interestingly, the blue line, representing worldwide gross, has a steeper slope than the red line, representing domestic gross. Therefore, movie producers may want to target international audiences, as a higher budget tends to mean more gains worldwide than domestically.

                        The task for this chart is to further explore the relationship between budget and revenue. By using a line chart, we try to identify a progression between individual points on the graph and further visualize

                        We can take away that for movies of the same budget, there can be a huge difference in domestic and worldwide gross.
                        While this is expected, the graph emphasizes how large this difference can be. 
                        Especially, for movies that have a very high budget, there is a larger difference in these two values. 
                        Additionally, the lines in the graph show how much the revenue can vary. The many peaks in the

                        This grouped bar chart illustrates the average domestic and worldwide box office revenues for movies
                        grouped by their rounded audience rating (from 1 to 10). For each rating level, we calculated
                        the mean gross revenue among all films that received that score.
                        From the chart, we observe that movies with higher audience ratings generally tend to earn more
                        both domestically and worldwide. The average revenue rises significantly for films with ratings
                        between 7 and 9. This suggests that positively rated movies are more likely to succeed
                        commercially. There is also a noticeable gap between domestic and worldwide gross in higher
                        rating levels, indicating a strong global appeal for well-rated films.

                        The main takeaway is the positive relationship between ratings and average gross. Both domestic and

                        should attract more viewers. The average worldwide gross is also always much higher than the 
                        domestic gross, which reinforces what we saw in previous graphs: that appealing to an 
                        international audience can be very financially beneficial.

                       for each of the categories appear very similar. Therefore, spending more money does not 
                       always mean a better quality film. Furthermore, this may possibly suggest that 
                       a higher budget does not account for higher revenue because of ratings, as ratings 
                       appear very similar across different categories of budgets.

                        The slope of the lines also appears to grow as the ratings grow, meaning that 
                        there is an even higher return for a better rating as ratings increase. 
                        Especially for top rated movies, the global revenue is much higher than the domestic revenue.

                        This bubble chart explores the relationship between a film’s production budget, worldwide box
                        office gross, and audience rating. 
                        The x-axis represents the film's Production Budget in dollars.
                        The y-axis represents the Worldwide Gross Revenue in dollars.
                        The bubble size/color represents the rating, where larger and brighter bubbles indicate higher
                        ratings.

                    <p class="text-section">
                        One takeaway is that the films that are the most significant outliers and make the most revenue need to have 
                        both a very high budget and a very high rating (such as Avengers: Endgame and Avatar: The Way of Water). 
                        Additionally, no matter what the rating category is, they all follow the trend of a higher budget tending to be
                        associated with a higher revenue. Therefore, even very highly rated movies with low budgets still make
                        much less than movies that are well rated with high budgets.

                            Our visual analysis explores the relationship between a film’s production budget, its box office
                            performance (both domestic and worldwide), and its audience reception. By combining insights
                            from line charts, scatterplots, and a custom-designed bubble chart, we reveal how these factors
                            interact in complex and sometimes surprising ways.

                            The line chart comparing production budgets with gross revenues demonstrates a general trend:
                            Films with higher budgets tend to earn more, particularly in the global market, where
                            international audiences significantly boost box office totals. However, the relationship is not
                            strictly linear. Many high-budget films exhibit greater volatility—some achieving
                            multibillion-dollar success, while others underperform despite massive investment.
                            Interestingly, films with moderate budgets (under $150M) are far more densely represented,
                            indicating that this range may offer a balance between market appeal and manageable risk.

                            The bubble chart adds a new dimension to this analysis by introducing audience rating as a
                            visual cue through bubble size and color. This chart highlights that high audience approval is
                            not limited to high-budget films. Many mid- or low-budget productions are highly rated,
                            suggesting that storytelling quality, creativity, and execution play a more decisive role in
                            audience satisfaction than raw financial input. Conversely, some high-budget films received
                            average or even poor ratings, reinforcing the idea that large production costs do not guarantee
                            critical or popular success.

                            Further insights from the visualizations on our website support these conclusions. For example,
                            genre analysis shows that certain types of films, such as dramas and documentaries, tend to earn
                            higher audience ratings, while big-budget genres like action or adventure often drive box office
                            returns regardless of critical reception. Additionally, rating stability appears linked to
                            popularity: movies with more votes tend to have consistent ratings, while lesser-known films
                            often exhibit polarized audience reactions. There is also evidence of an upward trend in both
                            average budget and global earnings over time, reflecting the increasing prevalence of
                            high-stakes blockbusters in the modern film industry.

                            These visualizations underscore a nuanced truth: while budget plays a role in shaping a film’s
                            financial potential, it does not dictate audience sentiment. The most successful films — both
                            commercially and critically — often strike a delicate balance between creative integrity and
                            production scale. Our findings suggest that studios may benefit from strategically investing in
                            mid-budget projects with strong storytelling, which can deliver both financial returns and
                            long-lasting audience impact.
